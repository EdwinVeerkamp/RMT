This package contains wicket gmap3 implementation.

History:
Original version of this lib is http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.wicketstuff/gmap2
Then there is a partial port of this lib to Google Maps V3: https://github.com/caraboides/wicket-gmap3 (but still Wicket 1.4)
And we have to lift this partial port to work with Wicket 1.5

Most of the code is copied and updated to compile against Wicket 1.5. 
Not all parts are fully tested. So before using a feature of this lib
check for the @ReviewPending annotation. Every class or method with this marker
has to be verified and checked, if it is stable and fully ported.

The code does not conform to checkstyle formatting rules. Reason: After reformatting it is very difficult to patch the code 
with new versions of this library

Event-Handling:
Event-handling is split into map-events and overlay-events. Don't know why they have been split. Maybe due to version2 design.
In version 3 it does not seem to be necessary. The code looks like it could be unified into one event processing unit.

Map-Events: package mapevent
Overlay-Events: package overlay
